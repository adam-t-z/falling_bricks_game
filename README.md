# 🎮 Turtle Brick Game 🐢🎲

Welcome to the **Turtle Brick Game**! 🧱 This is a fun and interactive game where you control a paddle to catch falling bricks, score points, and avoid losing the game when a dangerous brick hits your paddle.


## 🎮 Game Setup

To start playing, ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries:

1. Python 3.x
2. The `turtle` graphics library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### 📥 Dependencies
The game uses the following Python libraries:
- `turtle`
- `time`

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Your goal is to **catch** falling bricks with your paddle. 🧑‍🦱
- Each type of brick gives you a different score:
  - 🟠 **Circle brick**: 1 point
  - 🟩 **Square brick**: 2 points
  - 🐢 **Turtle brick**: 5 points
  - 🔺 **Triangle brick**: Special bonus (bricks move faster!)
  
- Avoid catching a **white turtle brick** ❌ which will end the game immediately! 

## 🎮 Controls
- **Left Arrow Key** ← : Move the paddle to the left.
- **Right Arrow Key** → : Move the paddle to the right.

The game will start immediately once you run the script. The game ends when a white turtle brick hits the paddle. At that point, the background will turn red, and the **Game Over** message will appear. 🚨
